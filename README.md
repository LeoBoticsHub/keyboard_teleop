# keyboard_teleop
This ros package allow to drive a robot through a /cmd_vel topic using keyboard keys. 

As default the command can be given only if the mouse focus is on the terminal where the program is launched; but if you want to send commands without any needs to be focused on the teleop terminal, i.e., you want to use the commands directly on simulation or anywhere else, you can set the ```terminal_focus``` parameter to ```false```. ATTENTION! this operation is risky, especially if you are using a real robot!!

## Dependencies

```
pip install pynput
sudo apt install xdotool
